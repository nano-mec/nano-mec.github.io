# Consulting and Fabrication Services

The NanoMEC team has over a decade of experience designing, building, modifying, and troubleshooting high-end cleanroom equipment and making the most sensitive detector circuits in the world.

Having previously worked in an academic environment, we know what it takes to keep older systems running like new ones and modify them to suit your specific needs.

## Full Wafer Fabrication Services

We provide consulting services to plan out the fabrication of new and novel circuits.

## Vacuum System Consulting Services

We provide consulting related to troubleshooting, repair, and upgrading of existing vacuum systems.

## Cleanroom Consultation for Academia and Small Businesses

Having played a critical role in the final stages of the recent renovation of the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/research/facilities/ifab">University of Virginia Innovations in Fabrication Lab</a> before founding NanoMEC LLC, I know what it takes to get a new or existing academic cleanroom running effectively.
