The Nano-1 is a proof-of-concept lithography system aimed to bring a micron-scale solution to the hobbyist market utilizing recent advancements in low-cost consumer-grade LCD and eventually DLP (Digital Light Processing) printing technology. This project is very early, and a white paper will be released in 4th quarter 2023.

# Objectives

Provide a low-cost all-in-one 10s-of-microns and eventually micron-scale patterning system.

1. Provide spin coating of low-cost consumer-grade photo resins
2. Utilize custom hardware with off-the-shelf consumer-grade LCD and DLP backbones.
3. Utilize both an open source software and hardware platform to reduce barriers to entry for hobbyists, educators, and small businesses alike

## Relevance

In a 2005 paper, JD Mustraves presented a ~10-micron scale maskless DLP projection lithography system built using <$5000 of consumer-grade hardware.

Commercial companies have improved on this process by releasing maskless DLP-based systems with resolutions approaching 1 micron. However, such systems often cost more than $100,000 and are unsuitable for hobbyist and small business markets.

With the advancement of DLP technology and the availability of inexpensive DLP evaluation modules, companies have extended this technology to low-cost photosensitive-resin-based 3D printing, reducing the cost to the hobbyist market by more than a factor of 10.

## Enhancing Qualitative Measurements

### Verifiability

NanoMEC can access work class optical and Scanning Electron Beam (SEM) analysis systems to provide quantitative measurements.

### Comparability

NamoMEC can access to commercial-grade maskless lithography systems for direct comparison to the state-of-the-art.

### Understandability

NanoMEC was founded by a lifelong learner and DIY hobbyist that understands the need of the community.
